You have had a hard day, and to-morrow we must plan your hours and go over your clothing to see what it is necessary to get for you. Nancy will give you a candle. Be careful how you handle it. Breakfast will be at half-past seven. See that you are down to that. Good-night.”</p><p>Quite as a matter of course, Pollyanna came straight to her aunt's side and gave her an affectionate hug.</p><p>“I've had such a beautiful time, so far,” she sighed happily. “I know I'm going to just love living with you but then, I knew I should before I came. Good-night,” she called cheerfully, as she ran from the room.</p><p>“Well, upon my soul!” ejaculated Miss Polly, half aloud. “What a most extraordinary child!” Then she frowned. “She's 'glad' I punished her, and I 'mustn't feel bad one bit,' and she's going to 'love to live' with me! Well, upon my soul!” ejaculated Miss Polly again, as she took up her book.</p></div> </div>
