An' I'm blest if I hain't thought of it ev'ry Monday mornin' since—an' it HAS helped, ma'am. It made me laugh, anyhow, ev'ry time I thought of it; an' laughin' helps, ye know—it does, it does!”</p><p>“But why hasn't—she told me—the game?” faltered Miss Polly. “Why has she made such a mystery of it, when I asked her?”</p><p>Nancy hesitated.</p><p>“Beggin' yer pardon, ma'am, you told her not ter speak of—her father; so she couldn't tell ye.
