Aunt Polly, what is a divorce?”</p><p>“But they aren't going 'way off, dear,” evaded Aunt Polly, hurriedly. “They're going to stay right there together.”</p><p>“Oh, I'm so glad! Then they'll be there when I go up to see—O dear!” broke off the little girl, miserably. “Aunt Polly, why CAN'T I remember that my legs don't go any more, and that I won't ever, ever go up to see Mr. Pendleton again?”</p><p>“There, there, don't,” choked her aunt. “Perhaps you'll drive up sometime.
