I never knew any one that did have, only the Whites—they're some rich. They have carpets in every room and ice-cream Sundays. Does Aunt Polly have ice-cream Sundays?”</p><p>Nancy shook her head. Her lips twitched. She threw a merry look into Timothy's eyes.</p><p>“No, Miss. Your aunt don't like ice-cream, I guess; leastways I never saw it on her table.”</p><p>Pollyanna's face fell.</p><p>“Oh, doesn't she? I'm so sorry! I don't see how she can help liking ice-cream. But—anyhow, I can be kinder glad about that, 'cause the ice-cream you don't eat can't make your stomach ache like Mrs. White's did—that is, I ate hers, you know, lots of it. Maybe Aunt Polly has got the carpets, though.”</p><p>“Yes, she's got the carpets.”</p></div> </div>
